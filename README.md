I'm a software developer from Germany, who's creating whatever he feels like.

My work consists of websites, command line tools, GUI-Apps and scripts that do some kind of task.

### These are some of my favorite projects.

![kaelus](/assets/kaelus.png)

**KAELUS** is a cross-platform (Windows & macOS) Desktop application written in C#, that extracts E-Mail-Addresses from any URL you enter.

By automatically scanning the source code of each and every link with the same host domain it is able to find email addresses that are listed on said domain, without having to go through them manually.


![kaleidolib](/assets/kaleidolib.png)

**Kaleidolib** is a C# library providing different style additions for command line applications. This might sound pretty useless in the first place (probably because it is), but there might be some cases, where colors actually come in handy.
